Absolutely — this is a critical concept that sits at the intersection of **data management** and **agentic AI adoption**. Let’s break it down from both the **strategy side** (Data Products) and the **AI consumption side** (MCP + agents).

## 1. What is a Data Product Strategy?

A **data product strategy** means shifting away from treating data as a by-product of systems (CRM, ERP, trading platform, etc.) and instead designing **data itself as a product**:

* **Ownership**: Each product is owned by a domain team that knows the business context, risks, and value of that data.
* **Packaging**: Data is organized, cleaned, documented, and versioned — much like a financial instrument or a software library.
* **Discoverability**: Products are catalogued and can be found by other teams or systems.
* **Quality & Trust**: Data comes with guarantees (freshness, accuracy, lineage, definitions) that make it reliable.
* **Access & Governance**: Products have clear entitlements, permissions, and audit trails.

This approach transforms messy “raw data pools” into **curated, consumable assets** that can be safely reused across the enterprise.

## 2. Why It Matters for Agentic AI

Agentic AI — AI agents that **observe, plan, and act** — are not like traditional BI dashboards or analysts. They:

* **Autonomously discover and query data** (not waiting for a human analyst to map fields).
* **Chain reasoning across domains** (e.g., sales + credit risk + operations).
* **Take actions or recommend decisions** in real time.

For agents to work correctly and not produce spurious or non-compliant outputs, they need **structured, well-defined, machine-readable data products**. Without them, agents will face:

* Ambiguous definitions (“customer” could mean account holder, household, or legal entity).
* Data quality issues (stale or inconsistent values).
* Compliance risks (accessing sensitive information without masking).

In short, without a **data product mindset**, agentic AI cannot scale safely or reliably.

## 3. How MCP Fits In

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard for agents to connect to external data and tools. Think of it as a “contract” layer:

* **Discovery**: Agents query the MCP server to see what data products are available (like browsing an app store).
* **Interfaces**: Data products must expose **stable APIs or query endpoints** via MCP, not just raw tables.
* **Metadata**: Each product must publish schema, semantics, lineage, and policies so agents can “decide” how to use it.
* **Access Control**: MCP enforces security (what an agent acting on behalf of a user is allowed to see).
* **Auditability**: Every interaction is logged — what agent called what data, when, and why.

So MCP is the “delivery rail,” and the **data product strategy is the packaging**. Without strong packaging, the delivery rail doesn’t matter.

## 4. Evolution Path: From Data Products → Agentic AI

Here’s how organizations typically evolve:

1. **Define Data Products**: Identify priority domains (e.g., customer, transactions, risk) and assign ownership.
2. **Standardize Metadata & APIs**: Publish product schemas, quality metrics, usage definitions, and surface them via APIs.
3. **Integrate with MCP**: Wrap data products with MCP-compliant endpoints so agents can discover and consume them.
4. **Enable Guardrails**: Add fine-grained access, masking, logging, anomaly detection to ensure compliant use.
5. **Iterate with Agents**: Start with narrow use cases (e.g., an agent that pulls KYC/AML checks or reconciles positions). Expand to cross-domain reasoning once trust is built.
6. **Continuously Evolve**: As agents expose new needs (e.g., “this data needs a timeliness metric”), fold those requirements back into data product definitions.

## 5. Why This Matters to Executives

From a **financial and strategic perspective**:

* **Risk Reduction**: Clear ownership and governance avoids regulatory breaches (e.g., GDPR, SOX, Basel III).
* **Operational Efficiency**: Reduces duplicated pipelines and reconciliations, lowering cost.
* **Faster Insights**: Agents can find and use trusted data instantly, cutting cycle times from weeks to minutes.
* **Competitive Advantage**: Firms with strong data product ecosystems will be first to deploy safe, scalable AI agents in production.

✅ **Bottom Line**: A **data product strategy is the prerequisite for enterprise-scale agentic AI.** MCP is the protocol that lets agents consume the products, but the value depends entirely on how well those products are defined, governed, and enriched with metadata.

Would you like me to map out a **“Maturity Model”** (levels 1–5) that shows how an organization evolves from basic data management → data products → full MCP-ready agentic AI adoption? That might be a helpful executive artifact.
